# Supplementary files for "An Introduction to MATLAB for Behavioral Researchers"

The supplementary data file included with the book includes two folders: The "data" folder contains example data files from published studies that are used in the examples discussed throughout the book. Each sub-folder represents an individual dataset, with the folders organized and named as they are referred to in the book. Note that for one dataset ("eyetrack"), additional files needed to be downloaded, as described in the instructions file within that folder. The "functions" folder includes additional functions that are needed for some of the examples and exercises discussed in the book. Details about where to place the files on your computer are discussed in Chapter 2.

For information about the book, see SAGE Publications' website (http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book239284) or the website of the author (http://www.cmadan.com/book.php).
